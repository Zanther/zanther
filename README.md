Strong understanding of advanced programming topics including interactive touch/gesture interfaces, application development paradigms, memory management, file I/O, concurrency, and multi-threading. Well-versed in agile methodologies, as well as design and development practices. Proven track record in delivering exceptional customer-centric digital solutions on time and within budget. I am committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.

I am also knowledgeable in advertising art, Web and mobile UI/UX design, and graphic design‚Äîdemonstrated experience in providing client support and customer care.

I am a passionate video gamer and content creator. I run a gaming channel on YouTube and social media called 16-Bit Otaku, with content created using Adobe Photoshop CC, iMovie, video cameras, and media editing software. I also ran a website for over 10 years, but due to bandwidth issues, I had to retire the website. You can go to youtube.com/@16bitOtaku to check out some of the content created.

I recently worked at GEICO, where I was responsible for designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining key innovative iOS features for the company's mobile application. During my tenure at GEICO, I analyzed and converted requirements into solutions, created UI/UX designs, wrote testable code, provided functional documentation, and conducted rigorous quality assurance testing to ensure compliance with corporate standards.
